            While the hamburger is typically associated with beef, there has been a surge in popularity of vegetarian
            and vegan burger options in recent years. These plant-based alternatives aim to replicate the taste,
            texture, and experience of traditional hamburgers using ingredients like mushrooms, beans, soy protein, and
            even beetroot. With advances in culinary innovation, these meat-free burgers continue to gain traction and
            satisfy the cravings of those following vegetarian or vegan diets.
